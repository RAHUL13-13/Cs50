            The ceremony took place on the appointment of a new ruler. Before taking office, he spent some time secluded
            in a cave, without women, forbidden to eat salt, or to go out during daylight.
            <br>
            The first journey he had to make was to go to the great lagoon of Guatavita, to make offerings and sacrifices
            to the demon which they worshipped as their god and lord. During the ceremony which took place at the lagoon,
            they made a raft of rushes, embellishing and decorating it with the most attractive things they had. They put
            on it four lighted braziers in which they burned much moque, which is the incense of these natives, and also
            resin and many other perfumes. The lagoon was large and deep, so that a ship with high sides could sail on it,
            all loaded with an infinity of men and women dressed in fine plumes, golden plaques and crowns. ... As soon as
            those on the raft began to burn incense, they also lit braziers on the shore, so that the smoke hid the light
            of day.
