            gold dust so that he was completely covered with this metal. They placed him on the raft ... and at his feet
            they placed a great heap of gold and emeralds for him to offer to his god. In the raft with him went four
            principal subject chiefs, decked in plumes, crowns, bracelets, pendants and ear rings all of gold.

            they raised a banner as a signal for silence.
